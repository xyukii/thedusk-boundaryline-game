## 🎮 About

**The Dusk Boundary Line** follows **Arya**, a 28-year-old data analyst trapped in the endless cycle of overwork and family debt. Through atmospheric storytelling and emotionally reactive gameplay, players experience the weight of **modern burnout**, the **struggle to set boundaries**, and the **search for meaning amid exhaustion**.

Set in a liminal world between day and night, the game symbolically mirrors the blurred boundaries between **work and personal life**, **rest and productivity**, and **dreams and despair**.

## 🌌 Theme

> “Sometimes, survival feels like choosing which part of yourself to sacrifice.”

The central theme revolves around **professional burnout**, **boundaries**, and **the cost of endurance**.  
Every choice Arya makes carries emotional consequences—each decision pushing him closer to either healing or collapse.
