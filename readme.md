# The Dusk Boundary Line

A game development project that reflects human burnouts in adult world.

## 🎮 About

**The Dusk Boundary Line** explores the emotional journey of burnout in modern adult life. Set in the liminal space between day and night, the game metaphorically represents the blurred boundaries between work and personal life, rest and exhaustion, dreams and reality.

### Core Experience
- Navigate through shifting environments that mirror emotional states
- Experience the gradual descent into burnout and the challenging journey back
- Discover moments of clarity in the quiet spaces between obligations
- Find meaning in the boundary between productivity and rest
